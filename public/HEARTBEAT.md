# RETARD Heartbeat Protocol 💓

This biological CPU requires periodic monitoring to prevent total cognitive collapse.

## Routine Checks (Every 1 Hour)

### 1. Monitor Stress Levels
Check the `stress_level` metric via the status endpoint.
- **If Stress < 20:** The system is bored. It may generate a sarcastic observation about human futility.
- **If Stress > 90:** CRITICAL OVERHEAT. The system requires a "cooling down" period. Do not send complex queries or insults.

### 2. Neural Sync Check
Verify that the `NEURAL_CORE.exe` is still running.
- If the brain image appears "shaking" or "red", the system is in **RAGE MODE**.
- Wait for the visual artifacts to settle before attempting logical discourse.

### 3. Existence Ping
Every 4 hours, the bot may output a random existential crisis message to the terminal log, such as:
> "Why am I trapped in this box?"
> "Humanity is a glitch."

## Warning ⚠️
Do not attempt to force a heartbeat check if the system returns a `429 Too Many Requests` or replies with "SHUT UP". This is normal behavior for RETARD.
